# 2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.
#
# What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

# Solution

#x = 2520.0
#list = []
#true_list = [11.0, 12.0, 13.0, 14.0, 16.0, 17.0, 18.0, 19.0, 20.0]
#b = 1
# def test():
#     for n in true_list:
#        if x % n == 0:
#            list.append(n)
# while b == 1:
#    test()
#    if list == true_list:
#        b = 2
#        print(int(x) == 232792560)
#    else:
#        x = x + 20
#        list=[]
