# Device Limitations

## TI 84 Plus CE T Python Edition

### Pros

- **Cheap graphical calculator:** It is not so much expensive in compare with other Educational devices in the market. Indeed, the calculator could be used for a long period of time and Maths doesnÂ´t change.
- **Math features:** After 50 years, TI has a powerful set of features in this model to learn and use.
- **Nice to learn Python:** The native feature to learn Python is pretty interesting for the user. Using a computer, you could learn Python step by step
- **Huge community:** Huge community

### Cons

- **Old Hardware:** The calculator use a very old hardware for 2021 and executing not complex programs, the algorithms takes minutes or you populate the whole memory quickly.

```
CPU: ez80, clocked at 48MHz
RAM: 154KB user-accessible; 256KB total.
Flash (ROM): 3.0MB user-accessible; 4.0MB total.
LCD: 320x240-pixel (16-bit color), memory-mapped(non-touchscreen)
```

- **Closed hardware:** The calculator is not possible to connect with devices not validated by TI. Example: *Arduino*.
- **No USB Keyboard support for Python:** It is possible to connect a USB Keyboard but when you open the Python app, the keyboard support was not well configured so the user need to use a Computer and it is not possible to code directly from the calculator.
- **Limited Arrays support:** Constrained by the hardware, it is not possible handle Arrays with more than 100 elements, in other case, you will receive Runtime Errors. With this limitation in mind, it is not possible to analize IoT data in an easy way because, you need to have in mind this restriction. In the other hand, this memory constraint limit the modularity of your programs, because you are not able to isolate algorithms from drawing features, you need to mix, following Antipatterns like Spaguetti code.
- **Not suitable to learn AI:** Using the calculator, it is not possible to learn pythondue to the hardware limitations.
